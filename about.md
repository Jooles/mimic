This is the development blog for the MIMIC JVM. I wanted a non-trivial side project with which to learn and practise the recent C++14 standard; something that hasn't been done a million times before. A JVM seemed like a good fit. Its core behaviour is well defined, but there is plenty of scope for experimentation and creativity in the actual implementation details. After mentioning this to some friends, a few of them said that they'd be interested to know how I approached such a project and so I promised to write about it as I go.

I intend to make this as approachable as possible, especially for relatively new programmers. A problem I have come across a few times in my development as a programmer is that, while there is often plenty of information about how to begin with a language or programming in a general sense, there is often very little information in between simple tutorial programs and large scale projects and heavy language references. Working on a large project is a great way to get an idea for how such a project is structured, but it can be hard to see why anything is the way it is. I hope that in writing this blog I can at least give an example of how to approach something ambitious.

I will assume that readers have a reasonable grasp of the Java language. Of course, please feel free to ask for clarification, or to question or discuss my decisions in the comments.
