## A clean-room JVM implementation in C++14

Why, you ask? Well C++98 is great and all but there comes a time in every developer's life when they need to knuckle down and catch up to current standards. I needed a project to work on and this is it!

I have no expectations that this will work or that it'll be good, but it's an educational tool so let's see what happens. As some people I know have expressed an interest, I'll be blogging about the process of writing this over at https://jooles.github.io/mimic

### Prerequisites
* GCC that supports --std=c++14
* libpthread (for tests)
* Doxygen (optional - if generated documentation is required)
* pdflatex (optional - if pdf documentation is required)
* Dot (optional - if diagrams in documentation are required)
