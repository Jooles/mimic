As it briefly mentions in the project description, I needed a project to give me something to do as I update my C++ knowledge from the C++98 standard to the current C++14 one, and as I'm a Java developer by day I thought that a JVM would be both potentially useful and interesting.

Seriously I'm beyond fed up with being stuck using Java 1.3 on Windows CE devices. It is the worst! If C# can have delegates and generics on there, then why can't I?

I don't expect this project to ever be "finished" (whatever that means), used by anyone, or even particularly good but it need not be any of those things to be worthwhile as an educational tool.

As for this blog? I wouldn't have chosen to make it as I'm not someone who cares much for attention but I've had people I know express an interest in seeing how I approach the task of writing a large and complex piece of software so I'm going to write about it as I go. The aim is to push a new blog post with every non-trivial commit. I will also figure out how to add a comment system before I get very far.

Until.... some point in the future where I start working on actual code!
