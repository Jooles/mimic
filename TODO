* Parse class files
  - Read all class file data into relevant data structures
  - Ensure class file is correct length (no trailing bytes and no truncation)
  - Write Utf8string class and use it in constant_poot::Utf8_info
  * Validate constant pool entries
  * Read attributes into distinct attribute
  * Validate lengths of known attributes
  * Validate field and method references
  * Rewrite Utf8string class to use a custom codecvt to avoid the need to use
    an intermediate code point value when converting to/from UTF-8
  * Add UTF-16 conversions to Utf8string class
